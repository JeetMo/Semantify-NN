# Semantify-NN: Towards Verifying Robustness of Neural Networks Against A Family of Semantic Perturbations

## About Semantify-NN:
We propose **Semantify-NN**, a model-agnostic and generic robustness verification toolkit for semantic perturbations. **Semantify-NN** can be viewed as a powerful extension module consisting of novel semantic perturbation layers (SP-layers) and is compatible to existing Lp-norm based verification tools. Semantify-NN can support robustness verification against a wide range of semantic perturbations: translation, occlusion, hue, saturation, lightness, brightness and contrast, rotations.
